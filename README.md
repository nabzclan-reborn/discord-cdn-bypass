## Endpoints

### Bypass Discord CDN URL
**Endpoint:**  
`https://public-api.nabzclan.vip/v1/discord-cdn-bypass/`

**Description:**  
This endpoint accepts a Discord CDN URL, downloads the file, saves it to the server, and returns a file URL. The file will be automatically deleted after 5 minutes.

**Request:**

```text
 https://public-api.nabzclan.vip/v1/discord-cdn-bypass/?apitoken=apitokenhere&url=<discord_cdn_url>
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                     |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `url`     | String | The full Discord CDN URL to bypass and download |

**Example Request:**

```text
  https://public-api.nabzclan.vip/v1/discord-cdn-bypass/?apitoken=apitokenhere&url=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1148078060407640084/1284251990146154542/IMG_0739.jpg
```

### Response:

**Successful Response:**

The API returns a JSON response with the `file_url` and expiration time.

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "File successfully downloaded and saved.",
    "file_url": "https://public-api.nabzclan.vip/v1/discord-cdn-bypass/uploads/unique_folder/file.png",
    "expires_in": "5 minutes"
}
```

**Error Responses:**

If the provided URL is invalid or unsafe:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Invalid or unsafe URL. Please provide a valid Discord CDN link."
}
```

If the `url` parameter is missing:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "No URL provided."
}
```

If too many requests are made in a short period (rate limiting):

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Too many requests. Please slow down."
}
```

### File Deletion:

The downloaded file will be automatically deleted from the server **5 minutes** after it is saved. The expiration time is provided in the API response under the `expires_in` field.

## Usage Notes

1. **Rate Limiting**: The API is rate-limited to prevent abuse. If you make too many requests in a short period, you'll receive a "Too many requests" response. Please wait for a moment before retrying.
2. **HTTPS Enforcement**: The API enforces HTTPS for all requests. If the request is made over HTTP, the API will automatically redirect to HTTPS.
3. **Auto-Deletion**: The downloaded file will be deleted from the server 5 minutes after it's saved. The API response provides the expiration time so users know how long they can access the file.

## Example Workflow

1. Send a GET request to the API with the Discord CDN URL.
2. Receive a response with the URL of the saved file and the expiration time.
3. Access the file within 5 minutes using the provided file URL.

**Example API Call:**

## FAQ

A: You can use tools like `curl`, Postman, or a browser to test the API by sending a GET request with the `url` parameter.

**Q: Is there any limit to the file size I can download?**  
A: This API is limited by your server configuration. Please ensure your server can handle the file sizes you plan to download.
